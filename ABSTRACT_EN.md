# Talk Abstract

Recursion schemes often come up as "something real FP programmers must know", which I can't help but take as a bit of a challenge.

The purpose of this talk is to help you, too, become a real FP programmer and, should help you understand when, and more importantly when not, to use recursion schemes.

# Talk Description

Recursion schemes are a topic that often come up in conversations with experienced, knowledgeable developers. For the longest time, I'd just nod and smile and pretend I knew what was going on.

The purpose of this talk is to help people in the same situation. Recursion schemes are far less scary and confusing than the mystique that surrounds them suggests, and this talk attempts to prove it.

We'll start from first principles and refactor our way to proper recursion schemes, discovering and explaining all the necessary concepts as we go along.

By the end of the talk, attendants should have all the tools they need to understand recursion schemes, and be able to explore the more esoteric ones on their own.

# Misc.

Recursion schemes are a subject that has long frustrated me - my brain just doesn't seem to fit the way they are explained in the available resources.

The point of this talk is to explain them the way I wish they'd been explained to me in the first place, by focusing on their practical aspects.

I feel qualified to speak on the subject because of how hard I struggled to make sense of it all - I probably fell in most traps it was possible to fall in. This gives me the experience needed to steer people away from these traps.
